# Java Script with HTML/CSS
Module 11 - Challenge

## Background

The project is to create a HTML page and embed CSS and Java Script programming. We started with a simple HTML page with a filter criteria and a static data file behind the scene. The ask was to add multiple filter criteria and enhanced the existing page so users can limit the searches by date, city, shape of the UFO sighting etc.

## Results

Here are the steps to browse and filter data:

​	Once the user access the URL the site presents itself all the data from the file is loaded on the page

​	To filter the specific data, the user can access the 'Filter Search' criteria located at the lower left hand side

​	At this point the user can either search by Date, City, State, Country or Shape

​	The user can also just enter one search criteria or multiple search criteria to narrow down the search results as shown in the 	    picture below:

<img src="C:\Users\Fahad.Rehman\Desktop\UW DataBootcamp\UFO\static\images\single search.PNG" style="zoom:67%;" /> <img src="C:\Users\Fahad.Rehman\Desktop\UW DataBootcamp\UFO\static\images\multiple search.PNG" style="zoom:67%;" />

​	Unfortunately to reset the search criteria the user either has to reload the page or click the 'UFO Sightings' button on the top	



## Enhancements

The page has a lot of drawbacks and a lot of enhancements can be done, for e.g.

- Page Drawback

  - No way to reset the filter criteria

  - User need to press 'Enter' for filter criteria to work, this can be dynamic in nature

  - The 'UFO Sightings' heading is really small and just on one side of the page, it should be in the middle and more visible

    

- Enhancements

  - Filter criteria doesn't support case-sensitive searches
  - if the search values are less than a drop down menu should appear so user know what to select for e.g. the column 'Shape' who knows what it means and what to search for. Shape of what ?
  - I only saw two two countries US and CA, I don't think a filter is needed for two values
  - Auto-Fill on search columns would be a great idea
  - 'Reset Search' button and 'Search' button would make sense to have it under the Search inputs
